## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- More practice with mobile-first responsiveness
- Hover and active button styles
- Using flexbox layout and `margin-top: auto` on the button to ensure it sits at the bottom of the card, regardless of text length.

### Useful resources

- [Josh Comeau's Interactive Guide to Flexbox](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/) - This resource was incredible for visualising flexbox concepts and helped me gain a better understanding on Flexbox layouts.
